[Bacterial_spot]
information = "Bacterial spot is caused by four species of Xanthomonas and occurs worldwide wherever tomatoes are grown.\ 
				Bacterial spot causes leaf and fruit spots, which leads to defoliation, sun-scalded fruit, and yield loss.\
				Due to diversity within the bacterial spot pathogens, the disease can occur at different temperatures and\
				it is a threat to tomato production worldwide.\
				Disease development is favored by temperatures of 75 to 86 F and high precipitation.\
				In North Carolina, it is more prevalent in seasons with high precipitation and less prevalent during dry years.\

[Early_blight]
information = "Early blight is a common tomato disease caused by the fungus Alternaria solani.\
				It can affect almost all parts of the tomato plants, including the leaves, stems, and fruits.\
				The plants may not die, but they will be weakened and will set fewer tomatoes than normal.\
				Early blight generally attacks older plants, but it can also occur on seedlings.\
				Stressed plants or plants in poor health are especially susceptible.\

[Late_blight]
information = "Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of tomato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of tomato plants.\
				The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated.\
				Late blight of potato was responsible for the Irish potato famine of the late 1840s.\

[Leaf_Mold]
information = "Leaf mold is not normally a problem in field-grown tomatoes in northern climates.\ 
				It can cause losses in tomatoes grown in greenhouses or high tunnels due to the higher humidity found in these environments.\
				Foliage is often the only part of the plant infected and will cause infected leaves to wither and die, indirectly affecting yield.\
				In severe cases, blossoms and fruit can also be infected, directly reducing yield.\

[Septoria_leaf_spot]
information = "Septoria leaf spot is a very common disease of tomatoes.It is caused by a fungus (Septoria lycopersici) and\
				it can affect tomatoes and other plants in the Solanaceae family, especially potatoes and eggplant, just about anywhere in the world.\
				Although Septoria leaf spot is not necessarily fatal for your tomato plants,\
				it spreads rapidly and can quickly defoliate and weaken the plants, rendering them unable to bear fruit to maturity.\

[Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite]
information = "The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops in New England.\
				Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops.\
				Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant.\
				They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions.\
				Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies\
				that help to manage mite populations. As with most pests, catching the problem early will mean easier control.\

[Target_Spot]
information = "Also known as early blight, target spot of tomato is a fungal disease that attacks a diverse assortment of plants,\
				including papaya, peppers, snap beans, potatoes, cantaloupe, and squash as well as passion flower and certain ornamentals.\
				Target spot on tomato fruit is difficult to control because the spores, which survive on plant refuse in the soil,\
				are carried over from season to season. Read on to learn how to treat target spot on tomatoes.\

[Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus]
information = "Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus Disease is widely spread and extremely severe in Somalia.\
				The disease can be easily recognised when tomato plants are infected at the seedling stage.\
				TYLCV causes severe stunting of young leaves and shoots, resulting in bushy growth of infected seedlings.\
				Tomato plants infected early in the season are normally stunted and excessively branched.\
				Such plants have terminal and axillary shoots erect while leaflets are reduced in size and abnormal in shape.\

[Tomato_mosaic_virus]
information = "Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and  Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) are hard to distinguish.\
				Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) can cause yellowing and stunting of tomato plants resulting in loss of stand and reduced yield.\
				ToMV may cause uneven ripening of fruit, further reducing yield.\
				Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was once thought to be more common on tomato.\
				TMV is usually more of a tobacco pathogen than a tomato pathogen.\
